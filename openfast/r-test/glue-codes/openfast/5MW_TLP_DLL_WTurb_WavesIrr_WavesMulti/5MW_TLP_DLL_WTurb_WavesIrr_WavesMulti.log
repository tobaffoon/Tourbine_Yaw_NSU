 FAST_InitializeAll:HydroDyn_Init:Waves_Init:VariousWaves_Init: The random number generator in use
 differs from the original code provided by NREL. This pRNG uses 8 seeds instead of the 2 in the
 HydroDyn input file.
 VariousWaves_Init:Changed WaveNDir from 13 to 15 so that an equal number of frequencies are
 assigned to each direction.
